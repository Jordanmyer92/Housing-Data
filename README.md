# Housing-Data

Data analysis for buying distressed property in Kansas City, MO. API's from the city of Kansas City to download up to date info on codes violations, dangerous buildings, and landbank. Data is exported to Excel for easy sharing. Parcel viewer is used to generate list of owners because API was incomplete.

Addresses the need for a streamlined approach to finding distressed properties and ownership information.
